Iris Flower Classification Model

Overview
This project develops a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The dataset contains sepal and petal length/width measurements for each flower. The goal is to build an accurate classifier to predict the species based on these features.

Dataset
The dataset used is the Iris dataset, which consists of 150 samples with the following attributes:
- Sepal Length (cm)
- Sepal Width (cm)
- Petal Length (cm)
- Petal Width (cm)
- Species (Target Label)

The dataset is stored in the `IRIS.csv` file.

Installation & Setup
To set up the environment and run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the Repository
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/AmulyaKR13/Iris-Classification-Model.git
   cd Iris-Classification-Model
  

2. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On macOS/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate      # On Windows
   

3. Install Dependencies 
   pip install -r requirements.txt


4. Run the Jupyter Notebook  
   jupyter notebook notebooks/Iris\ Classification\ model.ipynb
   

Machine Learning Approach
1. Data Preprocessing
   - Handling missing values (if any)
   - Feature selection and importance analysis
   - Data visualization using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`

2. Model Selection
   - Logistic Regression
   - Random Forest
   - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
   - k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)

3. Model Evaluation
   - Accuracy Score
   - Confusion Matrix
   - Precision, Recall, F1-score

Results
The best-performing model achieved high accuracy in classifying Iris flower species.
